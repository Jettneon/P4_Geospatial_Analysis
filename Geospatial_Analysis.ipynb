    "### **WHY GEOSPATIAL ANALYSIS?**  \n",
    "Geospatial analysis is crucial when dealing with location-based data. It helps uncover spatial relationships and patterns that can be used for making informed decisions in various fields, from urban planning to business intelligence. By analyzing geographic data, we can gain insights into regional trends, customer behavior, and optimal resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will apply geospatial analysis to explore the restaurant data in Bengaluru. This type of analysis will allow us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the geographic distribution of restaurants\n",
    "- Identify popular restaurant types and neighborhoods\n",
    "- Investigate trends in restaurant ratings, pricing, and amenities\n",
    "- Explore correlations between restaurant locations and their attributes"

    "**OBJECTIVE OF THIS NOTEBOOK**  \n",
    "This notebook focuses on geospatial analysis of restaurant data collected from Zomato, specifically for Bengaluru. We will analyze various aspects such as location, ratings, costs, and type of cuisine offered by restaurants across different neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this project, you will gain insights into:\n",
    "- How to work with location-based datasets\n",
    "- Techniques for visualizing and analyzing geospatial data\n",
    "- How to identify patterns and trends in a city's restaurant scene\n",
    "- The relationship between restaurant attributes (e.g., rating, cost) and their locations"

    "**CONTENT OF THIS NOTEBOOK**  \n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore a dataset containing information about various restaurants in Bengaluru, including:\n",
    "- Restaurant name, address, and contact details\n",
    "- Ratings, number of reviews, and type of meals offered\n",
    "- Neighborhoods, cost estimates, and available services (e.g., online orders, table bookings)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize Python libraries to clean the data, perform exploratory analysis, and visualize the spatial distribution of restaurants in Bengaluru. Additionally, we will focus on understanding customer preferences, such as the most liked dishes and common cuisines across different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BUSINESS CASE**  \n",
    "Imagine you work as a data analyst for a restaurant chain looking to expand in Bengaluru. The company is interested in knowing the optimal locations for opening new branches. Your task is to analyze the existing restaurant landscape to identify high-traffic areas with high customer ratings and preferences. The company also wants to understand what types of cuisines and restaurant styles are more likely to succeed in certain neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should answer questions like:\n",
    "- Where are the most popular restaurant types located in Bengaluru?\n",
    "- Which areas have the highest concentration of highly-rated restaurants?\n",
    "- How do restaurant ratings correlate with location and amenities?\n",
    "- Is there a particular area that stands out for specific types of cuisine?\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these questions, you will provide valuable insights for strategic expansion and decision-making."
