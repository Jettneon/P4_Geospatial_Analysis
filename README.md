# Geospatial Analysis of Restaurants in Bengaluru

## Overview
This repository contains a geospatial analysis of restaurants in Bengaluru, India, with a focus on uncovering trends, patterns, and insights related to restaurant locations, ratings, and customer preferences. The goal of this analysis is to provide a deeper understanding of how various factors such as location, restaurant type, and customer reviews influence the popularity and success of restaurants in the city.

Through this analysis, we aim to help restaurateurs, customers, and analysts make data-driven decisions regarding restaurant choices, location strategy, and menu offerings.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To explore and analyze restaurant data in Bengaluru to uncover trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- To clean and preprocess raw geospatial data for further analysis.
- To build and test hypotheses regarding factors influencing restaurant ratings and customer behavior.
- To visualize restaurant locations, ratings, and other key insights on a map.
- To provide a comprehensive introduction to geospatial analysis and visualization using data science techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes detailed information about restaurants in Bengaluru, sourced from the Zomato website. The dataset contains various restaurant attributes such as location, rating, customer reviews, and menu items.

This data is used to analyze the relationship between restaurant attributes (like ratings, price range, and location) and customer behavior, as well as the impact of neighborhood and cuisine type on restaurant success.

## Features
The dataset contains the following features:
- **url**: URL of the restaurant on the Zomato website.
- **address**: The physical address of the restaurant in Bengaluru.
- **name**: The name of the restaurant.
- **online_order**: Whether online ordering is available at the restaurant or not.
- **book_table**: Whether the restaurant allows table booking or not.
- **rate**: The overall rating of the restaurant (out of 5).
- **votes**: The total number of ratings the restaurant has received.
- **phone**: The restaurant's phone number.
- **location**: The neighborhood in which the restaurant is located.
- **rest_type**: Type of the restaurant (e.g., casual dining, fine dining).
- **dish_liked**: Dishes people liked at the restaurant.
- **cuisines**: Food styles (comma-separated).
- **approx_cost(for two people)**: Approximate cost for a meal for two people.
- **reviews_list**: A list of tuples containing reviews for the restaurant, with each tuple consisting of a rating and a customer review.
- **menu_item**: A list of menu items available at the restaurant.
- **listed_in(type)**: Type of meal served at the restaurant.
- **listed_in(city)**: The city or neighborhood where the restaurant is listed.
